iOS hibernation. Basically Sentinel but better :)

Thank God exam week is over.

known issues:

- wake from button press takes a few seconds longer than it should. its because of the cpu underclock
- wake and sleep percent in prefs doesnt do anything because i'm a super-paper with a head full of confetti
